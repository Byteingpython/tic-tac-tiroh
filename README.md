# Tic-Tac-Tiroh
Tic-Tac-Tiroh is a **WIP** implementation of Tic Tac Toe over the [Iroh](https://iroh.computer) p2p protocol.

## Usage 
To play you first have to start the program without any arguments. This will cause the application to start waiting for connections to the display its NodeID.
```bash
cargo run
```

You can now give your peer that NodeID and specify it as the first argument.
```bash
cargo run <node-id>
```
